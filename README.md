# Juttle Twitter Adapter

Twitter adapter for the [Juttle data flow
language](https://github.com/juttle/juttle).

## Examples

Filter the real-time Twitter stream for all tweets containing "potus"

```juttle
read twitter -stream true 'potus'
```

Read the last 100 historical tweets referencing "potus":

```
read twitter -total 100 'potus'
```

## Installation

Like Juttle itself, the adapter is installed as a npm package. Both Juttle and
the adapter need to be installed side-by-side:

```bash
$ npm install juttle
$ npm install juttle-twitter-adapter
```

## Configuration

The adapter needs to be registered and configured so that it can be used from
within Juttle. To do so, add the following to your `~/.juttle/config.json` file:

```json
{
    "adapters": {
        "juttle-twitter-adapter": {
            "consumer_key": "...",
            "consumer_secret": "...",
            "access_token_key": "...",
            "access_token_secret": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

To obtain Twitter credentials, first set up a [Twitter App](https://apps.twitter.com/) and create an OAuth token.

## Usage

Historical searches are constrained by the fact that Twitter's API returns
tweets in reverse chronological order, but Juttle semantics require data points
to be emitted in order.

To handle this, the adapter buffers all the points in memory before emitting
them down the flowgraph. There is a limit to control how many points are
buffered, which defaults to 1000. This can be overridden using the `total`
option.

### Options

Name | Type | Required | Description
-----|------|----------|-------------
`stream` | boolean | no | filter the live Twitter stream (default: false)
`total`  | integer | no | maximum number of tweets to buffer (default: 1000)
`count`  | integer | no | limit the number of search results (default: 100)
`delay`  | integer | no | when emitting points into flowgraph, allow up to `delay` latency of point arrival
